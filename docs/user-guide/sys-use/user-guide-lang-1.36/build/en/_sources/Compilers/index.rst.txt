Compiler type
=============

Multiple compilers are available with the |post-k|.
For information on using the compiler, see:.

- :ref:`Compilers that generate binaries for compute nodes <CompilerforCN>`
- :ref:`Compilers that generate binaries for login nodes <CompilerforLN>`

Programs that run on compute nodes are compiled using :ref:`Compilers that generate binaries for compute nodes <CompilerforCN>`.

Use the cross-compilers :ref:`Fujitsu compiler <FujitsuCompiler>`, :ref:`LLVM <CompilerforCNLLVM>`, and :ref:`GCC <GCC_MPI>` to generate binaries that run on compute nodes on login nodes.
