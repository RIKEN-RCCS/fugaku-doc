Runtime environment variables
=============================

We describe the main environment variables which is specifiable when execution on Fortran/C/C++ program.
The environment variables described here differ when using the LLVM OpenMP library (-Nlibomp option) and when using the Fujitsu OpenMP library (-Nfjomplib option).

Please refer to the manual "Fortran User's Guide", "C User's Guide", and "C ++ User's Guide" for details.

   * - Environment variables
     - Description

   * - OMP_NUM_THREADS
     - | The number of threads to operate in parallel can be specified.
       | If omitted, the number of cores available for the job (48 for 1 node and 1 process) is used.

   * - OMP_STACKSIZE
     - The size of the stack area for each thread can be specified in bytes, K bytes, M bytes, G bytes, and T bytes.
       The default value is 8 Mbytes.

   * - Environment variables
     - Description

   * - PARALLEL
     - | The number of threads to operate in parallel can be specified.
       | If omitted, the number of cores available for the job (48 for 1 process per node) is used.
       | 
       | When the environment variable FLIB_FASTOMP is set to TRUE (default), if the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS has a specified value, that value and the specified value of the environment variable PARALLEL must match.
       | If not matched, the smaller number of threads is used. In this case, the jwe1042i-w message is output.
  
   * - OMP_NUM_THREADS
     - | The number of threads to operate in parallel can be specified.
       | If omitted, the number of cores available for the job (48 for 1 process per node) is used.

   * - THREAD_STACK_SIZE
     - | The size of the stack area for each thread can be specified in Kbytes.
       | If the environment variable OMP_STACKSIZE is specified, the larger specified value will be the size of the stack area for each thread.

   * - OMP_STACKSIZE
     - | The size of the stack area for each thread can be specified in bytes, K bytes, M bytes, or G bytes.
       | If the environment variable THREAD_STACK_SIZE is specified, the larger specified value will be the size of the stack area for each thread.
