Compiler mode
=============

C++ compiler of  \ |post-k|\  has two modes with different user interfaces.

The mode to use is selected by the option of the translation command.

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 5


   * - Mode name
     - Translation option
     - Description

   * - trad mode
     - | \-Nnoclang
       | Or
       | when omitted
     - - It is based on the Fujitsu compiler for systems prior to K and PRIMEHPC FX100.
       - The trad mode is suitable for cases where importance is attached to compatibility with conventional Fujitsu compilers.
       - Supported format is C++03/C++11/C++14/C++17(part) and OpenMP 3.1/OpenMP 4.5(part).
       - For details on trad mode, read from "Chapter 2 From Compilation to Execution" to "Chapter 8 Debugging Functions" and "Appendix" in the C ++ User's Guide
       - If omitted the translation option,  \ ``-Nnoclang``\  option will be applied.

   * - clang mode
     - \-Nclang
     - - Based on Clang / LLVM compiler, which is open source software.
       - The clang mode is suitable for translating programs that use the latest language specifications and open source software.
       - Supported format is C++03/C++11/C++14/C++17 and OpenMP 4.5/OpenMP 5.0(part)
       - ACLE and FP16 support clang mode only.
       - For details on clang mode, please read "Chapter 9 Clang Mode" in the C ++ User's Guide.

.. attention::

  - The option system at the time of translation between clang mode and trad mode is different. Therefore, care must be taken when changing the compiler mode used for program translation.
  - Even if the same option is specified at the time of translation, the optimization results may differ between clang mode and trad mode.
