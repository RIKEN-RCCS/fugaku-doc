2. Create a program
 
  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ emacs sample.f08


3. Compiling
 
  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ frtpx -Kfast,parallel -o sample sample.f08

4. Create a job script
 
  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ emacs sample.sh

5. Job execution
 
  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ pjsub sample.sh

6. Display a job status
 
  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ pjstat

7. Confirm a result

  .. code-block:: console
  
   [_LNlogin] $ less ./sample.sh.jobid.out
   [_LNlogin] $ less ./sample.sh.jobid.err
   [_LNlogin] $ less ./sample.sh.jobid.stats
