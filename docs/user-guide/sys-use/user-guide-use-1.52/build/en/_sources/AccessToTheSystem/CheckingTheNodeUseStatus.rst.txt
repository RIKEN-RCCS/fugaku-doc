Check node usage
================

To check the total number of available nodes and free nodes, use \ :program:`pjshowrsc`\  command.




.. code-block:: console
  
  [_LNlogin]$ pjshowrsc
  [ CLST: cluster1]
  RSCUNIT           NODE
                    TOTAL  FREE  ALLOC
  ResourceUnitName     14    13      1

.. note::

    If the user executing the \ :program:`pjshowrsc`\  command does not belong to a group with submission privileges, no information will be displayed.

    Additionally, executing the \ :program:`pjshowrsc`\  command without specifying a group may result in no information being displayed.
    In such cases, you can specify the group you belong to using the \ ``-g``\  option as shown below to check the status of computational resources available under that group's permissions.

.. code-block:: console
  
  [_LNlogin]$ pjshowrsc -g [GROUP_NAME]

Also, a summary of the number of jobs is displayed if specify \ ``--summary``\  option to \ :program:`pjstat`\ . At a summary of the number of job, the number of jobs submitted by the user who executed the \ :program:`pjstat`\  command (all users when the \ ``-A`` \ option is specified) is aggregated and displayed for each status as shown below.

.. code-block:: console
  
  [_LNlogin]$ pjstat --summary
  
    ACCEPT QUEUED RUNING RUNOUT   HOLD  ERROR REJECT   EXIT CANCEL  TOTAL
         0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0
  s      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0

.. note::

    The line with "s" at the beginning of the line is the number of jobs including sub jobs.
